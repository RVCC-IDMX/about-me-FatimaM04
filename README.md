# Welcome to my README! 

## Description

This is for The About Me Project, which I have been cumulatively been working on the past few weeks. The project's purpose is to use the skills I learn in Web Dev 1 each week and apply them towards my personal website. As the weeks have gone on, I've learned how to add images and links, paragraphs, lists, embed videos, create a web contact form, add in a navigation bar and how to style appropriately according to my personal tastes. It's been a labor of love, and I'm excited for others to see my hard work!

## Color Scheme

For the color scheme, I wanted an earthy and calming feel for the webpage, so I decided to go with a variety of differnt shades of green and purple, with some whitesmoke. I thought it would offer a nice contarst while being muted and modern at the same time.

I didn't use all the colors on this pallet, mostly just the darker green; `#4e725a`, `rgb(78, 114, 90)`; and purple; `#946fb6`, `rgb(148, 111, 182)`; for a better contrast, and the lighter green; `#C3D6C9`, `rgb(195, 214, 201)`; in the background, along with some hints of WhiteSmoke, `#f5f5f5`, `rgb(245, 245, 245)`; to brighten certain areas of the page.
